This is a read me file for the project sword personal game. 
Working title is "Portal Conquest: Cadia's last stand"

Player controlls the camera to move/look around with the W,A,S,D keys where 
W: is to move forward
A: is to move left 
S: is to move backwards
D: is to move right

the players mouse is also tied to the camera position on ther screen where eg. if the player moves their
mouse to the left then the camera will follow to the left.

to buy a turret, the player must select a turret in the bottom of the game, then select a node to build on
, these nodes will turn green if the player has enough fund to build a turret there. 

there are two types of turrets a player can build and upgrade. 
The standard turret is a machine gun with a low cost but meduim fire power.
the Tank turret is a M4 sherman tank with a high cost but low rate of fire.

both these turret have an upgrade which not only changes their damage and range but they also get a visual
upgrade. 

to upgrade the player selects a node with a turret already build on and then clicks the node and a screen
should appear with the option to upgrade or sell.

there is a slight bug with the tank turret where the tank is so big that it blocks the upgrade click, to get
past this bug just click on the whote of the node the tank is on, this allows the player to upgrade the tank.

there is an pause button, just press the esc key or p to pause the game, and their are some options that come up, 
to contine, retry and menu. 

there is a bug where if you press retry is will start over and will not allow the enemies to spawn though when testing it rarly appeared. Recommend not to retry when
playing.

Pressing the menu button will take you to the menu.
